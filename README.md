## Description

As part of our second weekly challenge, we were asked to create our very first online portfolio, which we will use to display the projects we complete through the duration of the class. 

As part of this assignment, I applied my newly-learned skills in the following:

- HTML5 to organize and structure the webpage
- CSS3 to apply styles and responsiveness to the webpage

## Usage

Here you will find a link to the deployed webpage:

*https://wkerby.github.io/my-webpage/

## Credits

The portfolio website was completed in conjunction with the software development boot camp provided by the Georgia Tech professional development program.

Some useful pages I used to help me through the project inlcude:

*https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/

## Features

- Fragmented links that direct end-user to the relevant portion of the webpage
- Clickable image links that direct end-user to the refactored Horiseon website from challenge (and will direct him/her to other pertinent projects as class progresses)
- style.css file compliant with semantic html and compliant with responsive web design
