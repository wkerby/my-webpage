                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Will Kerby! I am originally from Birmingham, Alabama. I moved to Atlanta after graduating from Auburn University where I studied Industrial and Systems Engineering and work at 
                    Brasfield & Gorrie, LLC. Brasfield & Gorrie is a Birmingham-based general contractor with footprints in diverse markets spanning from Healthcare to Mission Critical. We have project sites as far west as Dallas, but the majority of our work is in the Southeastern United States. 
                    Though I work for a general contractor, I work in its Information Technology department as a Project Analyst and oversee projects that involve our internal software devlopment team. I have worked around software engineering long enough to want to take my career in that direction!

            <p>This is an aside. Not really sure what to do about this yet! I need to add more
                filler text to see what it will look like though.
