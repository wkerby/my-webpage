                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Will Kerby! I am originally from Birmingham, Alabama. I moved to Atlanta after
                    graduating from Auburn University where I studied Industrial and Systems Engineering and work at
                    Brasfield & Gorrie, LLC. Brasfield & Gorrie is a Birmingham-based general contractor with footprints
                    in markets spanning from Healthcare to Mission Critical. We have project sites as far west
                    as Dallas, but the majority of our work is in the Southeastern United States.
                    Though I work for a general contractor, I work in its Information Technology department as a Project
                    Analyst and oversee projects that involve our internal software devlopment team. In doing so, I have
                    developed an interest
                    in building web-based applications and want to take my career in that direction!
                </p>

                <h2>Bootcamp</h2>
                <p>The full-stack flex web development bootcamp, as its name implies, covers aspects of the world of
                    web-based software
                    development. The course begins is divided into three phases, the first of which deals with front-end
                    tools. So far in the
                    bootcamp, I have learned the fundamentals of HTML, which is used to organize web-pages, and CSS,
                    which works hand-in-hand with HTML
                    and is used to style webpages. I have also learned very basic JavaScript variable declarations and
                    functions that will help to make my
                    web page more interactive as I progress through the course.
